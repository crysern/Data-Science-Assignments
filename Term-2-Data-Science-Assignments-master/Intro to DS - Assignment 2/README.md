Regression Data Exploration Report

Pick a dataset from below

Data is Plural Or Alan Liu’s Data Toychest Or Kaggle or Somewhere else!

IMPORTANT: You will need at least 3 numeric variables, so consider this when choosing your dataset

Submit a Jupyter Notebook with answers / reflections, code and or plots and include a link to your dataset!

There is no hard word limit I would expect approx a paragraph for each section.

1. Pick two numeric variables to compare. The dependent variable has to contiunous and numeric, otherwise its a classification problem and not really suitable for fitting a regression model.

•	Summarise them (means, ranges, distributions?)

•	Describe any data wrangling or feature engineering that was necessary. Remember, you can make new variables by combining information and using statistics. You can even turn **categorical data** into **numeric data** using dummy variables! Pandas even has a method to do this -> Pandas get_dummies()



2. •	Describe how they relate to each other (include a plot)

•	Are they correlated? How? Can we draw any conclusions from this?



3. •	Fit a simple linear model

•	Interpret the results, what can you tell about the variables from the model? Can you make any useful predictions?

•	Evaluate your model. How good is the fit?



4. •	Pick (at least one, perhaps many) extra independent variables and fit a multiple regression model

•	Interpret the results, what can you tell about the variables from the model? Can you make any useful predictions?



5. •	What ethical issues may arise from using these models to make predictions?

•	What extra data (more variables, better variables) would improve your current models, or allow you to make better, different models?
