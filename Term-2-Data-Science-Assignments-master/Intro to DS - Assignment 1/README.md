# Assignment Brief


Pick one Wikipedia entry that could benefit from correction through a decolonial lense.

Start by researching some specific data within Wikipedia and other archival sources related to London colonial histories, including but not limited to this list already started by Lucy Panesar.

Write a 500 word report considering how data science methods may be used to aid the process of updating the entry.

Questions to be answered:

•	If you wanted to edit this Wikipedia page from a decolonial view what kind of data would be needed?  

•	Is it available?  

•	Why has it been omitted?

•	What are the likely sources and potential challenges in accessing/using them? 

•	If available, how are datasets presented and how do we open and start looking at them? If not, what considerations would arise (in terms of access and presentation) for neccessary data currently missing?

•	Using data science approaches to answering questions about the lived experience of humans allows insights unavailable at scale potentially not possible with traditional manual research methods. However, there is potential for bias, reductionism, misrepresentation and dehumanisation. What are the advantages and limitations of using a data centric approach to your chosen Wikipedia edit?
